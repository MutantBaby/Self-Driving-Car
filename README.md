# Self-Driving Course with JavaScript, Neural Networks, and Machine Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the Self-Driving project! This intermediate-level project explores the fascinating intersection of JavaScript, Neural Networks, and Machine Learning to simulate a self-driving car. It's from Radu Mariescu-Istodor, a great teacher and youtuber. 

## Project Description

### Features

- **Neural Network Implementation**: The core of the project is the implementation of a neural network that enables the simulated car to learn and make decisions based on its environment.
  
- **Training Algorithm**: The project employs a machine learning algorithm to train the neural network. The car learns to navigate through the course by adjusting its behavior based on the current data.

- **Interactive Simulation**: Users can interact with the simulation, observe the training process, and witness the car's evolving ability to navigate the course autonomously.

### Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The entire project is developed using JavaScript, making it accessible to a wide range of developers.

- **Neural Network Libraries**: The project utilizes neural network concepts in vanilla JavaScript to facilitate the implementation of the learning algorithm.

- **Machine Learning Concepts**: Concepts used here are fundamental to the training process.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/self-driving-course.git`

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: `cd self-driving-course`

3. **Open Index.html in a Browser**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser to start the simulation.

## Usage

### Interacting with the Simulation

- Use interactive controls to influence the car's behavior and observe the real-time adjustments made by the neural network.
